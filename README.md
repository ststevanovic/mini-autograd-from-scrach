# Autogenerated by AI

Mini reverse-mode autodiff engine for the **ML Systems Bootcamp**.

## ðŸš€ Goal
Students must implement their own `Tensor` class (with `Add`, `Mul`, `Matmul`, `ReLU`, `Sum` and `backward`) inside a Jupyter notebook using numpy.

## ðŸ“‚ Structure
- `notebooks/` â€” student submissions (`phase-2-2-mini-autograd-engine-<name>.ipynb`)  
- `tests/` â€” CI tests that run on every PR  
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` â€” GitHub Actions workflow  

## ðŸ§ª How it works
- Each notebook must define a class called `Tensor`.  
- CI runs `pytest`, which will:  
  1. Load the notebook.  
  2. Extract the `Tensor` class.  
  3. Build a tiny linear+ReLU MLP.  
  4. Compare gradients to PyTorch.  

If everything matches â†’ âœ… student's PR will be merged.

### Environment Rules
- Allowed: Python stdlib + numpy
- Provided: torch (only for reference checks, **not** for your implementation)
- Forbidden: tqdm, pandas, subprocess, os, socket, sys, shutil, etc.
- If you need another library, open an issue and request it. CI will not pass otherwise.
